        <!-- Descriptions for the UK -->
        <li>
          <p>UK universities are the best Europe, with two or three regularly among top 10 in the world.
            After the United States, the United Kingdom has the second largest number of foreign students.
             These results were achieved with total expenditure on educational institutions of around 6 percent
            of GDP, nearly equal to the OECD average. There are several reasons why British universities lead the rest of Europe. 
            First, despite modest total spending on educational institutions as a percentage of GDP, British tertiary educational
           institutions spend more per students than their European counterparts. </p>

        <li>
          <p>The unique Ghanaian culture is a combination of practices, traditions and beliefs from the country’s different ethnic groups, of which there are more than one hundred. The capital city, Accra, is home to the University of Ghana, which is arguably the country’s leading educational institution. Another leading university is the University of Cape Coast, which shares the town of Cape Coast with a number of coastal forts that were used for slave trading during the colonial era, a reminder of Ghana's history. Famous Ghanaians include former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former prime minister Kwame Nkrumah and boxer Azumah Nelson.</p>
